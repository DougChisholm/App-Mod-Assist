Create a PowerShell deployment script called deploy.ps1 in the deploy-app folder that automates application code deployment to Azure App Service.

The script should work seamlessly with the infrastructure deployment by reading the deployment context file (.deployment-context.json) created by deploy-infra/deploy.ps1. When this context file exists, the script should not require any parameters.

The script should accept optional parameters for the resource group name and web app name, which override values from the context file if provided. Include switches to skip the build step (for redeployments) and to configure app settings after deployment.

The deployment process should:

1. Check for a .deployment-context.json file at the repository root and load values from it if available
2. Validate that Azure CLI is installed and the user is logged in
3. Build and publish the .NET application using dotnet publish
4. Create a deployment zip package with the DLL files at the root level (not in a subdirectory)
5. Deploy to Azure App Service using az webapp deploy with the clean and restart flags
6. Clean up the temporary zip file after deployment
7. Display the application URLs including the /Index page and /swagger endpoint

The zip file structure is critical - Azure App Service expects the DLL files at the root of the zip, not inside a subdirectory like publish/ or app/.

When the ConfigureSettings switch is used, the script should configure the connection string and managed identity client ID using values from the deployment context or by querying Azure deployment outputs.

Also create a deploy-app/README.md file documenting both the automated script usage and manual deployment steps. Make it clear that after running deploy-infra/deploy.ps1, users can simply run deploy-app/deploy.ps1 with no parameters.

The application URL to view the main interface is /Index not the root URL - make this clear to users.
