This is the order in which the coding agent should read and work on the prompts:

prompt-006-baseline-script-instruction,
prompt-001-create-app-service,
prompt-004-create-app-code,
prompt-005-deploy-app-code,
prompt-007-add-api-code

If the agent cant find the exact named matching file it shuld not try to make up any text or code and skip to the next one
